    <h2>What is a CNN?</h2>
    <img src="./images/cnn-diagram.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="CNN Diagram">
    <p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are specialized neural networks designed for processing data with grid-like
        structures such as images. CNNs excel at image recognition, classification, and processing tasks.</p>

    <h3>Key Components of CNN</h3>

    <div class="mt-5">
        <h3>Convolutional Layers</h3>
        <p>The convolutional layer is the core building block of a CNN. It applies a mathematical operation called
            convolution, using filters or kernels to extract features from input images. Each kernel scans the input
            image, producing feature maps that capture the presence of specific patterns such as edges, textures,
            and
            shapes.</p>

        <p>The convolution operation involves sliding a small kernel or filter across the input image, computing
            element-wise multiplications, and summing them to form an output. The stride parameter determines the
            step
            size of the kernel movement, influencing the size of the resulting feature map. Padding may also be
            applied
            to ensure consistent output dimensions.</p>

        <p>Through successive convolutional layers, CNNs learn hierarchical featuresâ€”from simple edges and textures
            to
            complex structures and objects. This hierarchical feature extraction significantly enhances the model's
            ability to accurately interpret and classify images.</p>

    <div class="mt-5">
        <h3>Pooling Layers</h3>
        <img src="./images/pooling-layers.png" class="img-fluid" alt="CNN Diagram">
        <p>Pooling layers play a crucial role in CNNs by progressively reducing the spatial dimensions of the feature
            maps, making the network more computationally efficient. This operation not only decreases the amount of
            parameters and computation required but also helps control overfitting.</p>

        <p>There are two main types of pooling methods commonly used:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Max Pooling:</strong> Selects the maximum value within each region of the feature map. It
                effectively captures the most prominent features and preserves critical information such as edges and
                textures.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Average Pooling:</strong> Computes the average value within each pooling region, providing a
                smooth and generalized representation of the features.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Pooling typically involves moving a small window across the feature map and extracting the maximum or average
            values. Similar to convolution, pooling operations also have parameters like window size, stride, and
            padding, which control the output size.</p>

        <p>By strategically using pooling layers, CNNs can capture essential features more effectively while
            significantly enhancing the network's overall efficiency and robustness.</p>

    <div class="mt-5">
        <h3>Fully Connected Layers</h3>
        <img src="./images/fnn.png" class="img-fluid" alt="CNN Diagram">

        <p>Fully connected layers, often found at the end of a CNN architecture, are responsible for making final
            predictions or classifications. These layers take the high-level features extracted by previous
            convolutional and pooling layers and map them to the desired output classes.</p>

        <p>Each neuron in a fully connected (dense) layer is connected to every neuron in the previous layer. This dense
            connectivity enables the network to learn complex combinations of features and patterns from the input
            data.</p>

        <p>While convolutional and pooling layers excel at extracting and compressing spatial features, the fully
            connected layers act as decision makers, interpreting these features to output class scores or regression
            values. In image classification tasks, the output of the final fully connected layer typically feeds into a
            softmax function to produce class probabilities.</p>

        <p>It's important to manage the number and size of fully connected layers to avoid overfitting, especially when
            working with limited training data. Techniques such as dropout are often applied to these layers to improve
            generalization.</p>
